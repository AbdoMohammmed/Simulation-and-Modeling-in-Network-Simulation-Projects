Developed a complete network simulation project focused on modeling real-world message delivery systems, using WhatsApp message transmission as a case study. The system applied Dijkstra’s algorithm to determine the shortest path between nodes (representing servers or devices) and modeled real-time network behaviors using Discrete Event Simulation (DES) principles with SimPy in Python.

Designed inputs such as node/edge count, packet loss probability, and congestion likelihood. The simulation generated outputs including average delay, packet loss rate, congestion events, and shortest path analysis. Data visualization was implemented through histograms, pie charts, and network graphs to support performance analysis and interpretation.

The project provided hands-on experience in:

Designing and simulating communication networks.

Implementing custom routing logic.

Applying random functions to simulate delay, loss, and congestion.

Measuring network performance and visualizing key metrics.

This experience enhanced my skills in network engineering, Python simulation, routing protocols, and performance evaluation.
